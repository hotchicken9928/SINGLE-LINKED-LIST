This is a simple C program for implementing singly linked list.

The program supports:
1. Insertion at beginning
2. Insertion at end
3. Deletion by value
4. Displaying the list

It uses basic structure and pointer concepts to manage the list.
This project helps to understand how dynamic memory and linked lists work in C.
